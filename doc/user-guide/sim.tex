\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Tests}
The test bench generates a number (default is 2) configurations of the
SPI that are highly randomized. The user can run the full test-suite  
with n-configurations using "sbt "test" -DtestName="regression"".

User can also run individual tests or test groups by substituting "regression" with
the relevant test name. A description of the tests is below:

\subsection{Code coverage}
All inputs and outputs are checked to insure each toggle at least once. An error
will be thrown in case any port fails to toggle.

The only exception are the \emph{almostEmptyLevel} and \emph{almostFullLevel}
which are intended to be static during each simulation. These signals are
excluded from coverage checks.

\subsection{Running simulation}

Simulations can be run directly from the command prompt as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  $ sbt "test"
\end{verbatim}

or from make as follows:

\texttt{\$ make test}

\subsection{Viewing the waveforms}

The simulation generates an FST file that can be viewed using a waveform viewer. The command to view the waveform is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  $ gtkwave ./out/test/Gpio.fst
\end{verbatim}
